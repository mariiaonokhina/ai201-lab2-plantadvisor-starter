# Spec: Tool Functions

**File:** `tools.py`
**Status:** `get_seasonal_conditions` — Pre-implemented, read through. `lookup_plant` — complete spec fields before implementing.

---

## Purpose

These two functions are the tools the agent can call. They retrieve structured data from the local plant database and seasonal data files and return it to the agent loop, which passes it to the LLM as context for generating a response.

---

## Function 1: `lookup_plant()`

### Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `plant_name` | `str` | The plant name as entered by the user or chosen by the LLM — may be any casing, common name, scientific name, or alias |

**Output:** `dict`

When the plant is **found**, return:
```python
{"found": True, "plant": <the full plant dict from _plant_db>}
```

When the plant is **not found**, return:
```python
{"found": False, "name": <normalized input>, "message": <helpful string>}
```

---

### Design Decisions

*Complete the two blank fields below before writing code. The others are pre-filled for you.*

---

#### Input normalization

Strip leading/trailing whitespace and convert to lowercase before any comparison.

```python
normalized = plant_name.strip().lower()
```

---

#### Search order

Search in this order: direct key → display name → aliases. Keys are the fastest
lookup (O(1) dict access), so check those first. Display names are the next most
likely match for clean user input. Aliases are the broadest net, so they go last.

```
1. Direct key match: normalized in _plant_db
2. Display name match: plant["display_name"].lower() == normalized
3. Alias match: normalized in [alias.lower() for alias in plant["aliases"]]
```

---

#### Alias matching approach

*Aliases are stored as a list of strings. How will you check if the normalized input matches any alias in the list? Write your approach in pseudocode or plain English.*

```
It's best to build a normalized lookup dictionary once, mapping every possible name variant. Then, the query should be normalized before looking it up. 

For example, we will have a "normalize()" method that will strip extra whitespaces and convert the query/names to lowercase. Then, we will pre-build a name_index dictionary (hashmap) that normalizes all display names, scientific names, and aliases. Then, find_plant would find the plants from the normalized pre-built hashmap. Since there are 3 sources of names for each name total, they collapse into a flat dictionary and matching will take O(1) instead of nested loops.

The benefit of this approach is that we build the dictionary once and we reuse it for every query. 

We will also compute close matches in case there was a spelling error in the query using difflib.
```

---

#### Not-found message

*When a plant isn't found, the agent will read your message and use it to decide what to tell the user. Write the exact string you'll return — make it useful to the agent, not just to a human reading logs.*

```
"There is no exact match in the database for {plant_name}. 

{if len(closest_matches) != 0} This may be a spelling error. The closest matches in the database: {closest_matches}. Ask the user if they meant one of these before answering.

{else} Avaliable plants: {avaliable_plants}. Tell the user this plant is not in the database, suggest one of the available plants, and offer general care advice if appropriate, but do not invent plant-specific care details."
```

---

#### Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after implementing and running the app.*

**Test: does `"devil's ivy"` return the pothos entry?**
```
yes
```

**Test: does `"SNAKE PLANT"` return the snake plant entry?**
```
yes
```

**One edge case you discovered while implementing:**
```
Alias collisions. Because all name variants collapse into one flat hashmap
(_NAME_INDEX), if two plants share an alias the later-registered plant silently
overwrites the earlier one — the lookup still returns O(1), but for the "wrong"
plant with no error. Current data has no collisions, so it's not a live bug, but
it's a risk as the database grows. A guard in _build_name_index that detects a
key already mapped to a different slug would surface it early.
```

---

## Function 2: `get_seasonal_conditions()`

### Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `season` | `str \| None` | One of `"spring"`, `"summer"`, `"fall"`, `"winter"`, or `None` to auto-detect |

**Output:** `dict`

The full season dict from `_season_data`, plus one additional field:

| Added field | Type | Value |
|-------------|------|-------|
| `"detected_season"` | `bool` | `True` if auto-detected from the month; `False` if season was passed as an argument |

---

### Design Decisions

*This function is pre-implemented — read through these fields and the code before working on `lookup_plant`.*

---

#### Auto-detection logic

When `season` is `None`, get the current calendar month with `datetime.now().month`
and look it up in the `_MONTH_TO_SEASON` dict, which maps month numbers to season strings.

```python
current_month = datetime.now().month
season_key = _MONTH_TO_SEASON[current_month]
```

---

#### Season validation

If the caller passes an invalid season string (e.g., `"monsoon"`), the function
falls back to auto-detection — same as if `None` were passed. The `VALID_SEASONS`
set acts as the gate:

```python
VALID_SEASONS = {"spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"}
if season and season.lower() in VALID_SEASONS:
    ...  # use provided season
else:
    ...  # auto-detect
```

---

#### Return structure

The full season dict from `_season_data`, plus a `detected_season` boolean. Example for spring:

```python
{
    "season": "spring",
    "watering": "Increase watering frequency as plants break dormancy ...",
    "fertilizing": "Resume feeding with a balanced fertilizer ...",
    "light": "Days are lengthening — move plants closer to windows ...",
    "pests": "Watch for spider mites and aphids as temperatures rise ...",
    "detected_season": True   # True = auto-detected; False = caller specified
}
```

---

#### Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after testing.*

**Test: does calling with `season=None` return the correct season for the current month?**
```
Current month: [month]
Expected season: [season]
Returned season: [season]
```

**Test: does calling with `season="winter"` return winter data regardless of the current month?**
```
[yes / no]
```
